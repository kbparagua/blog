# About

## What is this site?
This is my personal blog.


## Okay. So, who are you?
I'm Karl, a <span class='js-age'>0</span> years old software engineer from the Philippines. I've been developing web applications and also irregularly producing half-baked side-projects for fun for the past <span class='js-work-years'>0</span> years. Besides cursing computers professionally, I also have a life outside that. I play sports, watch animes, listen to music, and other regular things that regular people do.

## Why blog?
I think this is my 5th try on blogging and I'm not that proud of saying that. Just a little backstory. When I was younger I used to write a lot. I may not be the best at storytelling or even grammar, but I genuinely like sharing my thoughts. But as you know, as we grow old our priorities change. I got to the point where I can't find time to write anymore. So I just stopped.

But this time I want to try it again. So yeah, I'm writing again. I'm not sure if I can do this consistently. But I'm very well sure that I don't want to pressure myself to the point of burnout. Just taking this easy. One post at a time.

## Is this a technology blog?
My work is in the tech industry so I have little choice but to talk about what I know. But other than that I will also write about random stuff about life. After all, I'm just a regular person who happens to be working with computers.

## Can I talk to you?

Uhm. Yeah, sure. Just email me at kb.paragua@gmail.com
